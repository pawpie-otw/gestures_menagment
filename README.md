# gestures_menagment
This program finally will allow you to do tasks by hand gestures 

I make this project for fun and improve my python skills.
This is just a begging but every day i try to improve this program and now it can detect your hand and if your fingers are bent or not.
I also try to compute hand angle and use to something really interesting.
